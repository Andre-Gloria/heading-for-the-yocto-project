=== License compliance and management

The Yocto Project aids the license compliance and management in products. It does not inform us what is required to be compliant with one or more licenses but produces a set of outputs which helps our legal team and technical department to do that.

Essentially it help us to:

* Avoid unnoticed license changes
* List the licenses included in a product
* Collect the source code for distribution, due license requirement
* Avoid use of specific license in a product (e.g. GPLv3)

The Yocto Project raised the bar in the license compliance aiding tools scenario. The outputs generated by it are very handy when we are checking the conformance of all licenses included in the project. The Yocto Project tools does not replace the legal department duties but assist them to do their work easier.
