=== Documentation

The Yocto Project documentation is perfect as a long term reference, when we are aware of what we are looking for, and has a base knowledge about its tools. This set of documents, along with this book, are a powerful combination to have around during the journey, diving into the Yocto Project.

There are several benefits of joining a community, some of those can be personal others professional. It is important that you find your own way to enjoy and contribute to the community that makes sense for you and is aligned to your goals. An advice, when joining a new community, is to follow the target mailing list in order to learn how that community behaves before actually starting to contribute and, at end of the day, become part of it.
